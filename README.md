# frozen-school

A coding project for IT2@vika-vgs 2023/2024.

This is a mystery/exploration sort of game where the player tries to avoid a frozen death for as long as possible. Built in a modular fashion, so plugging in new `Locations` should be very easy.

## Development

Run during development using `npm run dev`

## What's with the Express server?

Will use this for recording high-scores. Maybe also serving the app, we'll see.
