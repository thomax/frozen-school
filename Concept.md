# The Concept

Theme: "Frozen School" is set in a school during winter where the player awakens in the night to face a freezing environment.
The goal is survive as long as possible, against a dropping temperature. A temperature indicator emphasizes the urgency. 

### Temperature Mechanics
A dynamic temperature system that decreases over time and due to actions/events. There are ways to slow down or temporarily reverse the temperature drop (e.g., finding warm clothing, turning on heaters, ingesting warm food).

### Location-Based Challenges
Each location could present unique challenges or resources to help the player survive longer. Students are hopefully creative with their individual locations, drawing inspiration from their favorite subjects or school experiences.

### Replayability
Design each room with multiple outcomes or secrets to encourage players to revisit them. Implement random elements or events in rooms to ensure each playthrough feels different.

### Modular Design
Continue developing the game in a modular fashion, making it easy to plug in new `Location` components or features. Makes it easier to work independently on different parts of the game.

### User Interface
Design an intuitive UI that displays the temperature indicator and other crucial game information.
Maybe include a map or navigation system to help players orient themselves within the school.

### Storytelling and Atmosphere
Craft a compelling narrative to accompany the survival mechanics. This could include backstory, character diaries, or hidden lore within the school. Use descriptive text to create a chilling atmosphere that immerses the player properly.

### Documentation and progress
Encourage students to document their development process, including design decisions and code. Also, make students responsible for and aware of their own progress (or lack thereof) during development. Maybe a final presentation or showcase where students can demonstrate and discuss their contributions to the game.

## Educational Value
This project offers programming experience and fosters creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and an understanding of game design principles. It's a fantastic way for students to apply their coding skills in a fun and practical context.
